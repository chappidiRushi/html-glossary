### **Attribute**
A modifier of an HTML element that provides additional information about the element. Attributes are always included in the opening tag and usually come in name/value pairs.

### **Anchor Element**
The `<a>` element in HTML defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. The `href` attribute contains the URL of the page to be linked to.

```html
<a href="https://example.com">Link to example.com</a>
```

### **Body**
The `<body>` element contains the main content of an HTML document, including text, images, and other media.

```html
<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
```

## C

### **Canvas**
An HTML5 element used to draw graphics on the fly via scripting (usually JavaScript). It allows for dynamic, scriptable rendering of 2D shapes and bitmap images.

```html
<canvas id="myCanvas"></canvas>
```
### **Children**
Children refer to the elements that are nested inside a parent HTML element.

```html
<div>
  <p>This is a child element.</p>
  <span>Another child element.</span>
</div>
```

### **Class**
The `class` attribute in HTML is used to assign one or more class names to an HTML element. These class names can be used to apply CSS styles or to target elements with JavaScript. The `class` attribute allows for multiple class names separated by spaces.

```html
<div class="container highlight">
  <p class="text-center">This is a paragraph.</p>
</div>
```
## E

### **Entities**
Entities are special characters in HTML that are represented by a code starting with an ampersand (`&`) and ending with a semicolon (`;`). They are used to display reserved characters or symbols.

```html
<p>&copy; 2024 My Website</p>
<p>&lt;div&gt;HTML code&lt;/div&gt;</p>
```

### **Head**
The `<head>` element contains meta-information about the HTML document, such as the title, links to stylesheets, and metadata.

  <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
</head>
```

 ### **href**
The `href` attribute specifies the URL of a link.

```html
<a href="https://example.com">Link</a>
```

### **ID**
The `id` attribute is used to assign a unique identifier to an HTML element. It must be unique within the document, and it can be used to apply CSS styles or to target the element with JavaScript.

```html

  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</div>
```
