A modifier of an HTML element that provides additional information about the element. Attributes are always included in the opening tag and usually come in name/value pairs.

### **Anchor Element**
The `<a>` element in HTML defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. The `href` attribute contains the URL of the page to be linked to.

```html
<a href="https://example.com">Link to example.com</a>
```

### **Body**
The `<body>` element contains the main content of an HTML document, including text, images, and other media.

<body>
  <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
```

### **Class**
The `class` attribute in HTML is used to assign one or more class names to an HTML element. These class names can be used to apply CSS styles or to target elements with JavaScript. The `class` attribute allows for multiple class names separated by spaces.

```html
<div class="container highlight">
  <p class="text-center">This is a paragraph.</p>
</div>
```

 ### **href**
The `href` attribute specifies the URL of a link.

```html
<a href="https://example.com">Link</a>
```

```html
<div id="main-content">
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</div>
```
